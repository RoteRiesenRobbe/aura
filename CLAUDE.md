### Recent (cap 3 — older entries: `docs/archive/status-history.md`)

- **⭐ Last completed: FLIGHT PATHS C3 — THE CLIENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE** ✅ `bcfb4faf` 2026-08-05, **PO-verified in-game same day** — flight now runs end to end. Approach a discovered fire, **`E` lights over it**, `E` opens the map, two presses fly: the camera zooms out and hard-follows, the ability bar greys out and says why, an ETA counts down, and landing restores all of it. ⚑ **The feel pass reshaped the chunk, it did not just tune it — four more PO rulings:** the trigger moved from a bare map click to **`E` at the campfire**; a map opened with **`M` is read-only**, which **removes** the silent-refusal case instead of reporting it and so **shrinks C5** to the route overlay; a **second `E` closes** the map; and both knobs were cut — speed **4→2.8×**, viewport **2.5→1.75→1.2×**, the latter taking streamed area from ~6.25× to ~1.4× so **flight is no longer the mobile-perf cost §4.3 designed it as**. ⚑ **THE `E` BADGE SHIPPED SUPPRESSED AT EVERY LONELY FIRE AND THE HARNESS WENT GREEN ON IT**: the "hide while my own panel is open" guard read `offered === partnerId()`, and `partnerId()` is **0** when nothing is open — free while both operands moved together, wrong the moment the campfire offer made them diverge (`E` still worked; the key reads the tracked id, the badge the suppressed one). The harness could not see it because **a conversant stands within ~1.5 units of four of the five fires**, so every badge reading was taken beside one — now pinned by a leg scored first, at spawn, at the one clear fire. *General shape: a sentinel compared against a value that is also the sentinel.* ⚑ That same clustering made the first cut **unflyable at spawnpoint-2** (a conversant won the offer), so **the fire wins inside its bind radius** — 0.75 units against the 2.0 talk range, the tighter condition being the unambiguous intent; it is a **content** pattern and will recur. ⚑ **The flyer rendered UNDER props** — mobs are below characters deliberately (`6afbee84`) but `resources`/`bossMobs` are added after them, and altitude has no other cue, so a `flyers` layer now sits above the props and below darkness. ⚑ **The camera could not have kept up and it would have been misdiagnosed as flight speed** (`movementSpeed × 2` fixed in the constructor) — *a constant set once from a rate that later gains a second, faster mode*. ⚑ The ability lock has **four entry points**, so the guard belongs at the shared handlers. Verified: Go suite + `go build` · `tsc` clean · vitest **225/225** · **`c3-flight-client` 32/32, 0 console errors** — carrying **the two-client snapshot-invisibility leg C2 deferred** · `chunk3b-interact` 14/14 (the suppression fix touches NPC talk) · `c2-campfire-markers` 17/17 · `c1-world-map` 12/12 · boot 0 panics. **Schema impact: NONE.** Full ledger: `docs/plan-flight-paths.md` §10 C3.
- **Prior: FLIGHT PATHS C2 — THE FLIGHT STATE MACHINE, SERVER-SIDE** ✅ `bc01a45c` 2026-08-05, headless-verified (the in-game pass waits for C3 — no client can send `StartFlight` yet) — `StartFlight = 12` + three appended `Character` fields, validation, the lerp, landing. ⚑ **The mechanism is D13, decided in this session's plan review: flight REMOVES the flyer from the physics space** (body+hand+aura out, viewport stays — the flyer still sees) instead of a per-system suppression checklist — non-interaction is structural via the two §54 invariants (`RemoveShape`'s instantaneous purge + `ForgetDeparted`, both fired at takeoff), and **snapshot invisibility arrives free, shrinking C4 to the roster filter**. The enumerated remainder is the players-list gates: input discarded whole, aura off synchronously, utilities refused, the dwell tracker skips flyers (a slow fly-over would otherwise discover AND rebind), disconnect stashes the destination (D14 — no live-position column exists, so crash semantics are unchanged). ⚑ Finding: **`CancelCast` does not clear the pending press queues** — a same-tick UseUtility+StartFlight would have started a Recall cast mid-air; takeoff clears both queues. `Ground()` is the ONE re-entry (landing + WARP-cancel), so a half-restored flyer is unrepresentable. Verified: Go suite + `db-test` vs real Postgres · **~28 new Go tests** (incl. the 7-case rejection table + real-second-player invisibility) · vitest 207/207 + typecheck · `hygiene-wire-prune` clean (the `.fbs` gate) · `c2-campfire-markers` 17/17 + `campfire-bind-persistence` 6/6 (re-run — the dwell tracker was refactored) · boot 0 panics. **Schema impact: NONE.** Full ledger: `docs/plan-flight-paths.md` §10 C2.
- **Prior: WORLD MAP C3 — THE PLAYER ROSTER** ✅ `106585c4` 2026-08-04, PO-verified in-game same day — a new **`PlayerRoster = 7`** message carries every live character at **1 Hz**, and other players are dots on both map states. **The map is feature-complete for part 1** (D6's self + fires + players all drawn). ⚑ **The plan's §2 survey was WRONG and it made the chunk smaller**: it recorded that other characters already appear on the minimap, but `Character` sets `visibleOnMinimap = false` and only the local `Player` flips it true — nobody but you has ever been drawn. So the roster is the **only** source, not a second one, and **landmine 6 dissolves** into "skip your own id". Assembled **once**, marshalled **once**, the same bytes to everyone — a design requirement, not an optimisation, because part 2's flyer filter must have one home (the Go test pins the *same backing array*, which an equality assertion would not). ⚑ **PO ruling: the map's draw order is `terrain → props → other players → you → campfires`** — *"the campfire is still the most important information the map can provide"* — which **inverts C2's** fires-below-the-people rule. ⚑ **The world is NOT part of it**: building it to match was tried, bounced back from a PO screenshot within minutes, and reverted to byte-identical (`6afbee84` stands). A map marker ranks by information value; a world sprite by physical sense, and one harness leg now asserts **both** orders so nobody tidies them into agreement. ⚑ Its live consequence, **still open**: you respawn at your bound fire, so your own dot is invisible under that fire's marker until you walk off it. Verified: Go suite + `db-test` vs real Postgres · vitest **207/207** · **`c3-player-roster` 15/15** (run with a real third player online — the PO — after three `dots === 1` legs went red on exactly that) · `c1-world-map` 12/12 · `c2-campfire-markers` 17/17 · `hygiene-wire-prune` clean (the `.fbs` gate) · `filler-batch` back to its 1 recorded pre-existing failure · boot 0 panics. **Schema impact: NONE.** Full ledger: `docs/archive/plan-world-map.md` §10 C3.

### Next

- **World map part 1 is DONE, live, mobile-verified and ARCHIVED** (`docs/archive/plan-world-map.md`) — C1+C2+C3 all shipped 2026-08-04, the phone pass closed on a real device against the live build, and the deferred `features/map/` rename taken the same day (directory only: `MiniMap`, `IMiniMapRendered` and the `game.miniMap` harness handle keep their names). ⚑ Two tuning questions ride forward, owned by nobody yet: the marker sizes + dot colour are [PLACEHOLDER], and **your own dot is invisible while you stand at your bound fire** — which is exactly where you respawn.
- **`plan-flight-paths.md` continues at C4** (the roster filter — `codec.RosterFor`, the one visibility channel D13 does not cover; until it lands **a flyer is still a dot on other players' maps**, which is expected, not a defect), then **C5**. C1 shipped inside world-map C2; C2 + C3 both shipped 2026-08-05, C3 PO-verified in-game the same day. ⚑ **C5 SHRANK during C3's feel pass**: its confirm dialog existed mainly to give the silent refusal a voice, and the PO's `E`-at-the-fire ruling **removes that case** (an `M`-opened map is read-only, so the flight map is unreachable unless you are already standing at a discovered fire). What is left is the **route overlay**, plus one open question — whether a real dialog replaces the two-press arm or the arm simply stays. ⚑ Speed **2.8×** and viewport **1.2×** are PO-tuned but still [PLACEHOLDER]; the viewport cut also spent §4.3's mobile-perf premise (streamed area ~1.4×, down from ~6.25×).
- **backlog §48 — "there is one join path"** (the reconnect token is deletable) — traced `cd8fd4ba`, but **BLOCKED on §52** (leaving-the-world-takes-time, filed `94fec351`).
- ⭐ **STEP 8a IS DONE AND CLOSED** (PO 2026-08-04). ⚑ **It closes WITHOUT backups, deliberately**: the live server is still a testing ground even though it is externally reachable, and *infinite persistence is not the ultimate goal yet* — so losing the live database costs a playtest, not a player's history. Treat it as **losable**; nothing off-box holds a copy. **We will come back to it** — the natural trigger is the sacrifice loop, where a bloodline is by definition supposed to outlive the character. The rest of §8's ops work shipped by being used (provisioning + migrations, exercised live by `000002`). ⚑ The ruling covers **durability only** — the *security* items (cloud firewall, DB bound to localhost, credential handling, non-root deploy user) are untouched and still owed: `plan-playtest-deploy.md` §Ops & security posture. Ruling box: `docs/archive/plan-accounts-implementation.md` §8. ⚑ **Step 8b is NOT closed** by this (UI polish rest-of-checklist, avatar system, location music) — the 8a/8b split exists precisely so they close independently.
- **Next up: ASCENSION, the character-sacrifice loop** (persistence's first consumer, and now the visibly-next item) — ✅ **already DESIGNED 2026-08-04**, `docs/plan-ascension.md` (`e80c8a93`, 12 PO rulings D1–D12; ratifies backlog §36 and pre-rules §41). So the next session is **C1, not a design pass**. It owns the sacrifice transaction that 8a deliberately deferred, and it is where the backup question comes back: a bloodline is supposed to outlive the character.

### Open items

- **Needs a PO call:** `#registrationNag` covers the open mobile ☰ sheet (journal unreachable on phones; `mobile-layout.mjs` leg 7 legitimately red).
- **Intake round 8** (`plan-playtest-feedback.md` §Intake round 8): item 2 — stale quest info after turn-in (recommended: a third condition sentinel `running`); item 3's **feature** half — auto-walk (bug half shipped `c8163ad1`). Round 7: only **totem tooltips** (item 3, third raise) remains — needs catalog/data design.
- **Smaller open threads:** §47 the stale "Connection lost" banner in a second window · §51 transient second queue entry (readability) · a character-name **content** filter (spam registrations pass the charset guard) · mobile perf ceiling — PO: "works for now, needs some love" (cheapest next: `MOBILE_MAX_RESOLUTION` 1.5; the minimap is a second per-frame GL context).
- **Outside 8a, deliberately:** sacrifice transaction · `bloodline_unlocks` writes · avatar/faction defaults (blocked on `plan-avatar-system.md`) · the password-reset plan's own five questions.
- **Backlog watch items** (`docs/backlog.md`): §25 D+E · §27.2.4–7 (⚑ §27.2.6 needs re-surveying first — 1b/R5 moved its sites) · §29 lost-WebGL-context trigger unknown (detection shipped `6c8bde2e`; a blank world without the `[webgl]` log line is something else) · §37 skill-level/augment rework (coupled to the caps ruling) · §38 per-spawn level override · §39 entity-presentation rework (don't invest in per-effect overlay art before it) · §34 hard collision (not taken) · round-6 item 4 target stickiness (ruled unfixed; re-opens on measured cost, and its damage-smear half is what a playtester would report).
- **Known-inconclusive:** `chunk3-charm.mjs` red 6–8/9 across four runs (the accepted D9 fragility), HEAD baseline hung — not cleared.
- **Open PO calls: none outstanding** (2026-07-29 sweep). Replacement art + domain parked until v1; wiki generator kept.

- **Standing locks & gotchas:** growth **1.12 × maxLevel 30**; regen **0.00033 ≈1%/s × taper 1.0→0.4** FINAL; §11 no-pity + campfire **0.12** + heal cost **10 % → 2 % of max HP across its 10 levels** FINAL (the numbers rewrite converted the old absolute 10−2/level to a fraction; it was already exactly 10 % of the pool); **the base damage aura stays FREE at every resource level** (round-6 ruling — no cost curve may ever leave a player with no action; GDD §3); drop + milestone tables are **TUNING-OPEN** (milestones: Damage@L1 seeded at creation · **Discipline@L5** · Haste@L7); density = mob visible per ⅔-screen window; downtime 10 s + chain 20; guardrail asserts in `cmd/simharness/guardrail_test.go`. New mobs: inherit the Session-⑥ XP rule (facetank kph, else kite ×0.5) and **must** author tier + baseline (raw `maxHealth` hard-fails). Day/night cycle is **OFF** (`DAY_CYCLE_PRESENTATION_ENABLED=false`, bug unfixed — don't re-enable without collapsing the ~25 per-layer filter passes). Per-chunk placeholder values live in their plan docs. **A shape removed from `phy.Space` is purged from every other shape's collision set on the spot** (backlog §54) — do not "optimize" that sweep away: systems read those sets in priority order (`MobSystem` 20 → `PhysicsSystem` 0 → `NetSystem` −100), so an entity removed at the bottom of a tick is otherwise still visible to sensors at the top of the next one, and one stale read is enough to re-latch it forever. **Dev cheats:** GOD, WARP `<x·120> <y·120>` (1-unit granularity — land on a whole unit), SPEED, XP, SKILL, ANNOUNCE, THREAT, QUEST (dump / `ACCEPT <id>` / `ABANDON <id>` / `ADVANCE <id> <from> <to>`). `make -C backend build` runs `cp-defs` (reverts embedded `backend/pkg/api/` from `api/`); boot `-content ../api` for content iteration (schema/Go changes still need the rebuild).

## Development Principles

These principles apply to all code written or modified in this project.

### KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid

Prefer the simplest solution that works. Avoid clever abstractions, unnecessary
indirection, or premature generalization. If a function does one clear thing in
20 lines, that's better than a "flexible" version in 80. When proposing
architecture, start with the simplest design that satisfies the actual
requirements — not the imagined future ones.

### DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

Knowledge should have a single source of truth. If the same logic, constant, or
configuration appears in multiple places, extract it. Watch for subtler
duplication: parallel switch statements, repeated validation patterns, copy-paste
between similar systems. But: don't deduplicate things that just *look* similar
— two pieces of code that happen to be identical today but represent different
concepts should stay separate.

### YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It

Don't build for hypothetical future requirements. No "we might need this later"
parameters, configuration options, or abstraction layers. Add complexity only
when there is a concrete, present need. This applies especially to the aura
system: build what the current design requires, not what every possible future
combination might require.

### TDD — Test-Driven Development

For new features and bug fixes:

1. Write a failing test that captures the desired behavior
2. Write the minimum code to make it pass
3. Refactor if needed, keeping tests green

This applies to backend Go code (`go test ./...`) primarily, and to the
frontend's pure logic modules where a runner now exists (`npm test`, see
Frontend tests). For exploratory prototype work or UI tweaks, strict TDD may be
relaxed — but any non-trivial game logic (aura calculations, combination
resolution, damage application) should have tests before or alongside the
implementation.

When fixing a bug: first write a test that reproduces it, then fix.

## Project Overview

**Aura** (formerly Berryhunter; module path `github.com/RoteRiesenRobbe/aura`, local workspace dir `aurahunter`) is a multiplayer top-down browser MMO built on the Berryhunter survival-game foundation. The repo has three main parts:

- `backend/` — Go game server (`aurad`)
- `frontend/` — TypeScript/webpack browser client using PixiJS
- `api/` — Shared FlatBuffers schemas and the authored content JSON (mobs, skills, recipes, zones, props, factions, milestones)

`docs/README.md` is the docs index — it holds the naming convention and the four-layer status model (this file = current state · `roadmap.md` "Execution order" = sequence · `plan-*.md` §13 banners = per-chunk ledgers · `MEMORY.md` = cross-session index).

**`docs/` = live work, `docs/archive/` = finished work.** Plan docs referenced by bare name below (e.g. `plan-mob-depth.md`) are in `docs/archive/` once their work has shipped; anything still in `docs/` proper has something open. When a plan's last chunk lands, `git mv` it into `archive/` and move its index line to the README's Archive section.

## Build & Run

### Backend (Go ≥ 1.22)

```bash
# One-time: copy config
cp backend/conf.local-windows.json backend/conf.json   # Windows
# or use backend/conf.default.json as a template

# Build
make -C backend build          # produces backend/aurad

# Run (dev mode serves static frontend too)
cd backend && ./aurad -dev

# Run without build (go run)
make -C backend dev
```

> **Gotcha:** after backend logic changes, rebuild the binary with `make -C backend build`.
> `go build ./...` compiles/type-checks packages but does **not** refresh `./aurad`,
> so a running `-dev` server keeps executing stale code.

> **Content iteration:** `./aurad -dev -content ../api` loads items/mobs/skills/recipes
> from the repo `api/` directory directly instead of the embedded copies — JSON edits then skip
> both `cp-defs` and the rebuild (a server restart still applies them). The boot log prints the
> content source (`Loading content source=…`). Production/default stays embedded.

`backend/conf.json` controls server port (default `2000`), day/night cycle durations, and all game-balance tuning values. `backend/tokens.list` must exist with at least one token (e.g. `plz`) for in-game commands to work.

### Local database — required for EVERY boot

`aurad` **refuses to boot** without `AURA_DB_URL`, and panics without `AURA_JWT_KEY` (step 8a
chunk 1c). That includes headless harness runs. One-time setup:

```bash
make -C backend db-up                                   # Docker Postgres, named volume, both DBs
cp backend/.env.local.example backend/.env.local        # then put a real random key in it
```

`scripts/dev-restart.sh` sources `backend/.env.local` automatically (an already-exported value
still wins), so a plain restart works in any shell. `backend/.env.local` is **gitignored** —
credentials never live in the repo.

**Two databases on one server, and the split is load-bearing:**

| Database | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `aura` | durable dev data — characters survive restarts and container removal |
| `aura_test` | **disposable** — `AURA_TEST_DB_URL` points here |

> ⛔ **Never point `AURA_TEST_DB_URL` at `aura`.** Every DB-touching test calls `store.Rollback`,
> which drops the whole `game` schema, before *and* after itself. Aimed at the dev database it
> deletes every account and character silently — the run still goes green. Use
> `make -C backend db-test`, which aims correctly.

Targets: `db-up` · `db-down` · `db-shell` · `db-test` (store + accounts vs `aura_test`) ·
`db-reset` (recreates `aura_test` empty; never touches `aura`).

⚑ **The dev database now accumulates residue.** Playwright verify runs leave `hrnss_*` characters
behind, which used to die with the throwaway container. `backend/cmd/harnessdb -cleanup` clears
them — but **stop `aurad` first**: it holds live sessions the DELETE never reaches, and cleaning up
under a running server has already corrupted save games once.

⚑ **Dump before any migration test against real data**, and stop `aurad` first so it flushes
(`💾 flushed N live character(s) for shutdown`):
`docker exec aura-dev-db pg_dump -U aura -d aura --clean --if-exists > /tmp/aura-dev-backup.sql`.
Full runbook: `docs/manual-db-migrations.md` §4.

### Frontend (Node 20 / npm 10)

```bash
# Dev server (webpack HMR on port 2001) — no Docker
cd frontend && npm install && npm run start

# Production build
npm run build                  # output goes to frontend/dist/

# Docker-based alternatives (if local Node unavailable)
make -C frontend dev           # dev server via Docker
make -C frontend build         # prod build via Docker
```

### Opening the game

```
http://localhost:2001/?token=plz&wsUrl=ws://localhost:2000/game
```

Optional dev query params:
- `&develop` — opens the draggable dev panel
- `&start-cmds=GOD,GIVE BronzeTool,...` — runs server commands on spawn

### Backend tests

```bash
cd backend && go test -timeout 60s ./...
```

The full suite runs and passes. (`backend/pkg/aura/net/net_test.go` is a manual `ListenAndServe` smoke script that used to hang the suite; it is now skipped via `t.Skip` — remove the skip to run it explicitly.)

The test runner requires generated files (`go generate ./...`). The Makefile `gen` target runs this automatically before builds.

### Frontend tests

```bash
cd frontend && npm test          # vitest run
npm run typecheck                # tsc --noEmit
```

Vitest (added with the round-4 tooltip fix) covers the pure, DOM-free logic
modules — currently `SkillTooltip.ts`. Three things to know before adding a test:

- **The environment is `jsdom`, not `node`** (`vitest.config.ts`). The client's
  module graph reaches `window` at *import* time — `Urls.ts` derives the catalog
  host from `window.location`, PixiJS wants a document — so even a pure
  formatting unit needs a browser-shaped global.
- **`vitest.setup.ts` stubs `fetch`.** `Skills.ts` and `Mobs.ts` fetch their
  catalogs on import; without the stub a unit test does real DNS. The stub
  rejects, which is the degrade path those modules are designed to survive.
- **Import `{describe, it, expect}` explicitly** — globals are deliberately off
  so `tsconfig.json`'s `types` array stays untouched. (`skipLibCheck: true` is
  on there because vitest's own `.d.ts` files use private identifiers that tsc
  otherwise reports against the app's `es5` target.)

### Code generation

```bash
# Regenerate Go enumer files and FlatBuffers bindings
make -C backend gen            # runs go generate ./...

# Regenerate FlatBuffers bindings (if .fbs schemas change)
cd api/schema && ./make.sh     # or make.bat on Windows
```

## Architecture

### Backend (ECS-based game loop)

The game server uses an **Entity-Component-System** architecture via `github.com/EngoEngine/ecs`.

- `backend/cmd/aurad/` — entrypoint; wires config, game, HTTP server
- `backend/pkg/aura/core/` — `game.go` constructs the ECS world and registers all systems; `Loop()` ticks at ~30 FPS (33 ms/tick)
- `backend/pkg/aura/sys/` — ECS systems: physics, mob AI, NPCs, skills, targeting, state (death/respawn), pre/post-update, plus `chat/`, `cmd/`, `equip/`, `statuseffects/` (deleted systems: scoreboard in the 2026-07-08 dead-feature prune, heater with step 7, decay with the §26 resource prune)
- `backend/pkg/aura/model/` — interfaces and concrete types for entities (`player/`, `mob/`, `npc/`, `prop/`, `corpse/`, `spectator/`, plus `vitals/` and `client/`)
- `backend/pkg/aura/items/mobs/` — the mob registry: definitions, catalog, `EntityType` resolution (the enclosing `items` package was deleted with the §28 item-system removal; only `mobs/` remains)
- `backend/pkg/aura/codec/` — FlatBuffers encode/decode for the WebSocket protocol
- `backend/pkg/aura/phy/` — 2D physics (circle/AABB collision, spatial hashing)

**Adding a new system:** implement `ecs.System`, register it in `core/game.go:NewGameWith()`, and add entity registration cases in the relevant `addXxx()` methods.

**Adding a new entity type:** implement the appropriate `model.*Entity` interface, update `game.AddEntity()`, and register in all relevant systems.

### Communication Protocol (FlatBuffers over WebSocket)

Schemas live in `api/schema/`:
- `client.fbs` — client→server: `Input`, `Join`, `Cheat`, `ChatMessage`
- `server.fbs` — server→client: `GameState`, `Welcome`, `Accept`, `Obituary`, `EntityMessage`, `Pong`
- `common.fbs` — shared types (`Vec2f`, `ActionType`, `AuraType`)

After editing `.fbs` files, regenerate bindings for both backend and frontend.

### Game Configuration (conf.json)

All numerical tuning lives in `backend/conf.json` (or `conf.default.json` for reference). The `game.player` block controls movement speed, aura radii, vital-sign drain/gain rates, and level-up scaling. Changes take effect on restart.

### Content Data (JSON)

All authored content lives under `api/` in eight directories — `mobs/`, `skills/`, `recipes/`, `zones/`, `props/`, `factions/`, `milestones/`, `quests/`. Each is loaded by `cmd/aurad/loaders.go` (`contentSources`); a missing directory hard-fails at boot. The `make -C backend cp-defs` target copies all eight into `backend/pkg/api/` so the Go build embeds them, so run it (or just `make -C backend build`) after editing any JSON definition — or boot with `-content ../api` to skip both (see Content iteration above). Keep `contentSources` covering every `api/` subdirectory, or a content edit silently no-ops.

### Persistence (PostgreSQL)

Since step 8a, `aurad` persists accounts and characters (with their game state) to PostgreSQL. **Every change must state its schema impact** — does it touch persisted state (accounts, characters, session/reconnect data, quest ledger, loadouts)? Even "no DB change" is a finding worth recording in the chunk ledger.

- Schema lives in `backend/pkg/aura/store/migrations/` as sequential `.up.sql`/`.down.sql` pairs, embedded via `go:embed` and auto-applied at boot (`store.Migrate`). **Shipped migration files are frozen** — schema changes are always a *new* pair, never an edit.
- Standing schema rules (`game.` namespace, no `ON DELETE CASCADE`, hash discipline, JSONB canonicalization) and the dirty-state recovery runbook: `docs/manual-db-migrations.md`. Table/column rationale: `docs/archive/plan-accounts-schema.md`.
- DB-touching tests (`store`, `accounts`) need `AURA_TEST_DB_URL` set and skip cleanly without it — "green without Postgres" is not a full pass.

### Frontend

The frontend is structured as feature modules under `frontend/src/features/`:
- `backend/` — WebSocket connection, FlatBuffers deserialization, entity snapshot management
- `core/` — game loop, entity manager
- `player/`, `vital-signs/` — local player state and HUD
- `game-objects/` — rendering entities (props/resources, mobs, characters, corpses) via PixiJS; `AuraRings`/`EffectPips`/`AuraTickIndicator` are the shared combat-readability overlays
- `input-system/`, `controls/` — keyboard/mouse/touch input
- `internal-tools/` — dev panel, console, overlay tester (only active with `?develop`)

**HUD event handling:** Use `pointerdown` (not `click`) for all interactive HUD panels. `MouseManager` (`input-system/logic/mouse/MouseManager.ts`) registers a `mousedown` listener on `document.documentElement` with `event.preventDefault()`, which suppresses the synthetic `click` event. `pointerdown` fires before this and is unaffected. `click` listeners on HUD panels silently never fire — this is not obvious from the source.

Webpack configs: `webpack.common.js` (shared), `webpack.dev.js` (HMR, port 2001), `webpack.prod.js` (minified output).

## Aurahunter Project Context

This fork of Berryhunter has been transformed into **"Aura"** — a top-down MMO.
The Berryhunter survival systems (vitals, crafting, temperature, hunger) have
been removed. The core loop revolves around the aura system described below.

The structural rename (execution-order step 7, `docs/archive/plan-rebrand-cleanup.md`)
is **done**: module path `github.com/RoteRiesenRobbe/aura`, package dir
`pkg/aura/`, binary `aurad`, FlatBuffers namespace `AuraApi`, title "Aura".
Remaining "Berryhunter" references are intentional: historical plan/archive
docs, `legacy: true`-tagged proving-grounds content, Kringel Games social/
rating links, and berryhunter.io domain URLs (no replacement domain yet).

### Vision

**Tagline:** MMO lite — resource vs. resource, as simplified as possible.

**Core principle:** Players and NPCs interact exclusively through **auras** —
circular effect fields that automatically apply to anything in range. No
targeting, no direct attacks. Positioning and cooldown timing are the only
skill expressions.

**References:** WoW Classic (progression, environmental storytelling), Gothic
1+2 (organic worldbuilding), Hotline Miami / Monaco / Rimworld (top-down art
direction — not isometric, not pixel art).

**Platform:** Browser-based.

### Core Loop

1. Player moves through a persistent shared open world
2. Encounters mobs / other players — own aura ticks automatically on anything in range
3. Damage, healing, buffs emerge from aura overlap; cooldown abilities modify temporarily
4. Combat ends → XP for all participants → possibly aura unlock
5. Level up → skill points → strengthen existing auras or unlock combinations
6. Explore world → find hints → unlock new auras / passives / cooldowns
7. Rearrange slots, adjust build, tackle harder content

### The Three Skill Categories

Players collect, level, and combine three categories of skills:

- **Active auras** — toggleable, have visible ranges in-world. **Exactly one
  active aura is on at a time**; the aura slots are a loadout (several equipped,
  one active, switchable mid-fight), not multiple simultaneously-active auras.
  Build variety comes from slot loadout, combination unlocks, and switch timing.
- **Passives** — passive bonuses, always on (these DO run in parallel)
- **Cooldowns** — active abilities with cooldown timers (triggered individually)

Mobs use the same aura system as players.

### The Resource

Every player and every NPC has exactly **one resource**. It represents HP, mana,
and everything else at once. Drops to 0 → death.

### Aura Combinations

- Combination unlocks trigger when specific skills reach specific levels
- Recipes are **curated, not algorithmic** and **not documented anywhere in-game**
  — the community discovers and shares them
- Combinations can cross categories (aura + passive + cooldown is valid)
- The result of a combination can itself be an ingredient for higher combinations
- **Variant auras** exist as rare world drops and are also combinable
- **Damage types** exist for mob resistances and build identity (fire, ice, physical, etc. — specifics TBD)

The combination system must technically support arbitrary combinations from day
one. Content (specific recipes) is added manually over time.

### Spellbook & Unlocks

The **spellbook** is the collection of all auras, passives, and cooldowns a
player has discovered. Five ways to obtain new entries:

1. **Milestone unlocks** — guaranteed at certain levels
2. **Monster kill unlocks** — certain mobs drop auras/passives on death
3. **World exploration** — clue anchor points throughout zones
4. **NPC teaching** — peaceful NPCs teach a specific aura on approach, often
   tied to nearby harvest-mobs that only that aura can damage (soft "profession"
   identity without a class system)
5. **Meta-progression** — sacrificing a max-level character unlocks new base auras account-wide

### World Design

Persistent shared open world, multiple connected zones for different level
ranges. Designed and built by hand — no procedural generation. Environmental
storytelling is central.

**Open-world dungeons** — no instances. WoW-Classic-style caves in the open world.

**Darkness & light** — certain areas (caves, tunnels between zones) are dark.
The tunnel between zone 1 and zone 2 serves as a natural tutorial for the role
concept (light aura forces a trade-off between light and damage; players can
support each other).

### Multiplayer

- Persistent shared world — everything visible, everything shared
- No formal groups in v1 — all combat participants receive XP
- No PvP initially (earliest 5 years out)
- **Players filling roles for each other is essential, not optional**, for all
  larger challenges (light support in tunnels, heal support at bosses, etc.)
- No griefing possible by design

### Numbers Are ALWAYS Placeholders

Every concrete number — max level, skill points at max, slot count, aura max
level, respec cost, drop rates, combination requirements, damage values, aura
radii — is a **placeholder** until explicitly marked as final.

Treat such numbers as examples for thinking, never as decisions made. When
numbers are relevant for an answer, ask first or propose concrete values for
discussion — never silently adopt them as set.

### Scope v1.0 (Must Have)

Accounts, aura system (base auras, cooldowns, first combinations), spellbook
with milestone and monster unlocks, progression (level, skill system, slots),
persistent world, 2–3 zones, mob types (normal/elite/boss), UI (resource bar,
XP bar, ability bar, aura panel, minimap, zone chat), campfire system, and
the **character-sacrifice loop** (moved *into* v1 by PO ruling 2026-07-19,
`plan-intermission-triage.md` item 10 / GDD §11 — it lands right after step 8
as persistence's first consumer).

~~Line-of-sight for auras~~ — **CUT 2026-07-10.** Auras pass through walls and
every environment object; props block movement, never effects. The `blocksAura`
flag was deleted 2026-07-11. See `gdd.md` §142/§163 and `roadmap.md` item 6.

### Not in v1.0

PvP, formal group system, economy, mobile, endgame raid events.

## Working Style

Work happens in two kinds of sessions:

- **Planning sessions** — a work item (an execution-order step) is designed plan-first and
  written up as a `docs/plan-*.md` doc: what changes and why, chunk breakdown, decisions,
  open questions, test strategy. No production code is written in a planning session.
- **Execution sessions** — a single chunk from an approved plan doc is implemented in its
  own chat, following that plan. Reference the plan doc + the chunk being implemented in
  explanations and commit messages.

Across both:

- **Plan before code, and pause between steps.** State the plan in plain text first for any
  non-trivial change (new file, new system, refactor, multi-file edit); don't silently chain
  multiple chunks in one session.
- **Propose options for design decisions** — don't commit to a direction unilaterally.
- **Never commit (or branch/push) autonomously** — only when explicitly asked.
- Treat the inherited physics, collision, and the WebSocket/FlatBuffers protocol as
  stable foundations. Extend, don't rewrite.
- When in doubt about game design intent, ask — don't infer from the codebase.

## Sanity checks after every step

Before declaring a step done:
- Run `go build ./...` from `backend/`
- Run the relevant `go test` for affected packages
- State the change's **database-schema impact** (even if "none"). If it touches persisted state: follow `docs/manual-db-migrations.md` (new migration pair, never edit shipped SQL) and run the `store`/`accounts` tests with `AURA_TEST_DB_URL` set
- For anything with a runtime surface, verify in-game (plan docs record per-chunk in-game checklists)
- Report the output — don't claim "done" without these checks.
